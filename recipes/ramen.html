        <li>1 tsp sesame oil           </li>
        <li>1 tsp olive oil            </li>
        <li>2 cloves minced garlic     </li>
        <li>2 tsp freshly grated ginger</li>

    </ul>
    
    <p><h3>Steps</h3></p>
    <ol>
        <li> Heat the oil in a medium-sized saucepan over medium heat. Once the oil is hot, you will add the garlic and ginger, and simmer until fragrant.</li>
        <li>add the rest of the veggies you want to cook—in this recipe, the carrots and mushrooms—and cook them until they soften up.                    </li>
        <li>Transfer the broth to the pot and add the rice vinegar, soy sauce, and Sriracha. Give the broth a good stir to combine the ingredients.       </li>
        <li>Let the soup simmer for about five minutes, then give it a taste and add more soy sauce or Sriracha if needed.                                </li>  
        <li>While the soup simmers, cook the Ramen noodles in a separate pot as per the packages instructions.                                            </li>
        <li>When done, drain, rinse under cool water, place into your soup bowl, and set aside.                                                           </li>
        <li>Once the broth is ready, spoon it over the noodles, then garnish the bowl with whatever you please!                                           </li>
    </ol>
